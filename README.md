## Agent-ready
The product exposes one MCP tool in `mcp/server.ts`. Register it in your agent with `.vscode/mcp.json` (Copilot) or `.mcp.json` (Claude Code). Cline stores MCP servers per machine, so add it once in the Cline settings panel.

## Gates
Run the prompt in `docs/GATE-REPORT-PROMPT.md` with your agent before every Moodle submission. The output is `docs/GATE-REPORT.md`.
